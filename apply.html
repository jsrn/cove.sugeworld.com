			<h3>Creating a Character</h3>

			<p>While not mandatory, creating a new character for The Baronship of Cove is encouraged. New and existing characters <strong>must</strong> abide by our character creation rules.</p>

			<h3>Character Creation Rules</h3>

			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Names must be appropriate for our low fantasy setting. "Geoffry Morana" is a good name, while "SirKiLlalot" is not.</li>
					<li>Names must not be lifted from mainstream media. If the name is not entirely original, we reserve final judgement on whether it is sufficiently obscure.</li>
					<li>Characters must not have excessively bright or neon hair. Non-natural colours are strongly discouraged without proper justification.</li>
					<li>Skills must comply with the rules outlined <a href="http://cove.sugeworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=15932.0" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
					<li>Humans and elves only! Cove is not a friendly place for the evil races such as orcs, drow and undead. Nor do they look kindly upon Gargoyles, regarding them as a strange corruption.</li>
					<li>Mondain's Legacy elves are allowed, <a href="http://cove.sugeworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=11444.0" target="_blank">but are limited.</a></li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h3>Beyond This...</h3>

	      <P>
	      Beyond this, character creation is up to the player, and mostly common sense.
	      No self respecting citizen of Cove is going to have pink hair, or a bright
	      green neon mohawk hairstyle.<BR>
	      After creating a character, you must consider another important factor; his
	      or her personality! Try and make your character unique, and visualise how
	      he or she would look in the real world. Also, consider any family he or she
	      may have.<BR>
	      Regarding skills, try and choose those that are true to your character. Even
	      if you are a Militia guard and going for a standard warrior's template, if
	      you have a spare skill points why not spend it on fishing and add another
	      dimension to your character's personality, as well as having something else
	      to do when no one else is on.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>And Finally...</U></B><BR>
	      On completion of the character creation process, contact must be made to
	      one of the Baronship Command via 
	      our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/DUKQRXf" target="_blank">dedicated Discord channel</a>.
		<BR><br>
	      
		  Please refer to the <A href="index.php?page=contacts">Contacts</A> page on how best to go about contacting one of Command.
	      <P>
	      Prior to meeting a member of Command, all potentials must read carefully
	      through the entire Baronship tome and pay particular attention to the
	      Roleplaying Guide and OOC Rules pages. Ye will be tested on ANY and ALL features of the tome, and made to swear the Oath.<BR>

		<center><i>"I, &lt;Your Name&gt; hereby swear loyalty to the Army, Baron Octiovus and Cove.
