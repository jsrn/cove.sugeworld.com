		<B><U>Creating a Baronship
	      Character</U></B><BR>
	      Creating a new character is <U>Not Mandatory</U> within the Baronship of
	      Cove. However, it is advised that you do create one. A small guide on character
	      creation follows below;
	      <P>
	      <B><U>Character Joining Rules</U></B><BR>
	      Everyone has to start somewhere, and this fact is no different in the Baronship
	      of Cove. Keep in mind some basic rules, which MUST be abided by;
	      <P>
	      1. No name should be out of character, such as "SirKiLlalot" or "Mister
	      pwnage".<BR>
	      2. No name should be stolen from main stream literature or films. <BR>
	      3. No neon or bright coloured hair.<BR>
	      4. Skills must be in line with the restrictions described by the guild rules.<BR>
	      5. No evil races: Drow, orcs, lizardmen and so on will be driven out by axe and sword!<BR>
	      6. Mondain's Legacy Elves are allowed, <a href="http://cove.sugeworld.com/forum/index.php/topic,11444.0.html" target="_blank">but are limited.</a><BR>
		  7. Gargoyles are not allowed.<br>
	      <BR>
	      <B><U>Beyond This...</U></B><BR>
	      Beyond this, character creation is up to the player, and mostly common sense.
	      No self respecting citizen of Cove is going to have pink hair, or a bright
	      green neon mohawk hairstyle.<BR>
	      After creating a character, you must consider another important factor; his
	      or her personality! Try and make your character unique, and visualise how
	      he or she would look in the real world. Also, consider any family he or she
	      may have.<BR>
	      Regarding skills, try and choose those that are true to your character. Even
	      if you are a Militia guard and going for a standard warrior's template, if
	      you have a spare skill points why not spend it on fishing and add another
	      dimension to your character's personality, as well as having something else
	      to do when no one else is on.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>And Finally...</U></B><BR>
	      On completion of the character creation process, contact must be made to
	      the one of the military officers, via
	      pigeon (ICQ - <A href="http://www.icq.com">http://www.icq.com</A>).
		<BR><br>
	      
		  Refer to the <A href="index.php?page=contacts">contacts</A> page for the pigeon cage numbers of military and civilian leaders.
	      <P>
	      Prior to meeting an officer, all potentials must read carefully
	      through the entire Baronship tome, paying particular attention to the
	      Roleplaying Guide and OOC Rules pages. Ye will be tested on ANY and ALL features of the tome, and made to swear the Oath.<BR>

I swear to follow all orders without question or contest and to defend and uphold the laws and customs of Cove, whilst fulfilling my duties to the best of my abilities and living my life true to the Covian way."</i></center>
