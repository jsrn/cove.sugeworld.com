		There are key locations dotted throughout
	      the Baronship lands and beyond, each holding unique value and reputation.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>Army Barracks, Cove</U></B><BR>
	      The stronghold of the Covian Army. Here the Covian guardsmen are trained
	      and prepared for the field. Guardsmen make frequent trips to the storeroom to replace
		  lost equipment or get last minute repairs before heading off to duty. On the ground floor
		  are the cells, where criminals and traitors are held before trial.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>The Covian Church, Cove</U></B><BR>
	      The Covian Church has had an unsteady history. Many times it has been broken,
	      and rebuilt. And at worst, it has suffered complete removal from the Covian
	      community. However, it returns, more menacing than ever, there to instill
	      discipline and fear to the good, hard working folk of Cove.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>The Green Goblin, Cove</U></B><BR>
	      Cove's favourite tavern, run by none other than Hardened Guardsman Grief
	      the Dryfh Gry. Check here for ale, music, and other complexities that ye
	      may nay find on the open market.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>Town Hall, Cove</U></B><BR>
	      The Town Hall is where all important diplomatic or internal matters are considered.
		  The Covian Council, the Baron, and other community leaders may meet to discuss
		  various matters of importance. All are free to attend and watch the discussions.
	      <P>
	      <B><U>Orc Fort, Cove</U></B><BR>
	      The pit of Cove resides just around the mountain. For many ages an Orc force
	      has positioned itself there, building high barricades and defences. The Covian
	      Army regularly see to attacking this fort, but have never successfully been
	      able to break the Orc presence there. At best, the Orcs remain confined to
	      their taken land.
