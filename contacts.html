We don't use ICQ anymore for communication. It served us well over the years but we have now become prolific users of Discord 
(as have most of the Europa roleplaying community).<BR>
Please join us on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/DUKQRXf" target="_blank">dedicated Discord channel</a> and say hello!</p>
