      Not many know the true story that hides within the Von Richter family, and
      not many shall ever know. Conrad Von Richter, the barons less seen brother,
      a man of mystery, passion and great religious devotion. Named after his ancestor,
      the first ruler of Cove, Duke Conrad Gavestone. The Von Richter brothers
      are rumoured to be of a great nature, but none has ever come close to realising
      their intentions, hopes or identity. Octiovus the sword wielder, the younger
      and more impulsive brother while Conrad spent his time in libraries studying
      alchemy, mathematics and cartography.
      <P>
      Rumour has it that bitterness rests within Conrads soul, that he believes
      HE is the true destined ruler of Cove. A religious figure in great contact
      with the spiritworld, not often seen in public but in public nonetheless.
      Only time shall tell what the coming road reveals for the Von Richter family,
      a long and adventurous journey it shall be.
