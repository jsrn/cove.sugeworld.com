    <TD valign="top"><B><U>Gregor Eason, Commander (Retired)</U></B><BR>
      <B>Name: </B>Gregor Eason<BR>
      <B>Age: </B>Forty Summers Old<BR>
      <B>Birthplace: </B>Britain
      <P>
      Gregor grew up as an adopted child amidst a noble family in Britain. He was
      perhaps only a few years old when he was abandoned by his mother, left at
      the door step of a Healer's Hut. Baby Gregor was pitied by the wife of a
      respected Duke on a good will visit to an orphanage, and his life was changed
      for the better. The Eason family saw that Gregor was well educated in Literature,
      Philosophy, and the Virtues; and the family guard saw that he was trained
      in combat and arms lore.
      <P>
      Gregor lived a happy and free life in the Eason family, but he yearned for
      more. He yearned for adventure, for intrigue, for mystery... for new lands.
      Gregor enlisted into the Britannian Army on an officer's commission and served
      for several years, reaching the rank of Captain of a respectable infantry
      company.
      <P>
      During his service, Captain Gregor Eason took an active role in the defence
      of Trinsic when it was attacked by Undead forces, and was amongst the first
      to travel to the Lost Lands and provide reconnassiance for Britannian forces.
      <P>
      Although he served a distinquished career in the Army, Gregor still bears
      the scars of a military life. As the enthuisastic young always rush off to
      battle, he has realised pain and suffering through a life of fighting, not
      to mention his foul drinking habits...
      <P>
      Gregor seeked a quieter life, and thus his story leads to Cove. A small,
      peaceful settlement far from the cold and merciless battefield, or so he
      thought... Upon arrival he discovered that Cove lay occupied by an Orc horde,
      and that a mighty conflict had only just begun for the town of Compassion.
      Gregor could have walked away... he was a retired soldier. However, it seems
      a warrior can never resist the call to arms.
