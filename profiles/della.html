      <B>Name:</B> Dellamona Dellalany<BR>
      <B>Known As:</B> Della<BR>
      <B>Age: </B>22<BR>
      <B>Gender: </B>Female<BR>
      <B>Occupation: </B>Cook/Tavernkeeper
      <P>
      <B>Appearance</B><BR>
      Della is around 5ft4" and she has a good posture, her hands are so small
      and tiny that Della almost always drops her "cookery" book, also her hands
      have some burns on them. She has tiny feet also , her feet are on view at
      times and when they are you notice they are very very small.
      <P>
      She has a slim body that is very well toned from lifting all the flour, she's
      got a slight scar on her lower back but only an intermate can see this as
      she always covers up.
      <P>
      Her hair is a fair light brown colour that draps down her shoulder, its soft
      and smells always of lemons. Her eyes are like stars, it is as though someone
      placed stars in her eyes instead. She shows alot of emoton through her eyes,
      so watch her carefully. Her nose is small and twitchy, she has a habit of
      twitching her nose when she is in danger. Her lips look so soft to touch,
      and they truely are, she use's bee's wax to keep them smooth.
      <P>
      <B>History</B><BR>
      She is Donwin's sister so its pretty much the same except she doesnt remember
      her mother, or rather she choses not too. Her father was her best friend
      and she was so distrote when he died.
      <P>
      She has never been married or had a lover infact. She wishes that her life
      was more like Donwin's. Della is very jealous of her sister....especially
      her marridge to Mhoram.
