      short)<BR>
      <B>Race: </B>High Elf
      <P>
      <B>Appearance</B><BR>
      Tall, measuring 6 feet. His eyes are a deep set emerald colour, with a faint
      sparkle. He has strong elven features and he does nothing to conceal it.
      His hair is jet black and tied back at the nape of his neck with a black
      silk ribbon. He's fairly handsome and has a very slight sinister look about
      him. He speaks Britannian with a pronounced Elven accent and can at times
      even be difficult to understand. His body is muscled, but not overly so.
      He looks to be in his early twenties.
      <P>
      <B>Background<BR>
      </B>Khaelieth came from an elven community which had endorsed itself in a
      stalemated war with a local human settlement. None were strong enough to
      defeat the other. The elders of the tribe then sought peace with the humans.
      This was achieved, but the elves had to let the humans enter the woods to
      chop lumber.
      <P>
      Khaelieth always hated it, opposing the elders at every turn. Then, growing
      desperate, he led an ill-fated attempt to sieze power, which ended with his
      exile along with his fellow conspirators. He now roams Britannia, using his
      skills to earn money...
