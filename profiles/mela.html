      <B>Background</B><BR>
      Mela was originally born into the Darion family as the sister of Lex and
      Dellan Darion. Not long after birth Mela was kidnapped by a drow by the name
      of Zilverin and his dark elf slave Larien and taught the harsh ways of the
      drow for five years. When Mela was finally returned to her family, it was
      decided Yew was not the best place for a child to grow up in, so she was
      sent to stay with distant relatives that lived in cove, however, news of
      Cove's invasion had not yet reached Yew so it wasn't known that the relative's
      were either long gone or dead. For week's Mela lived on her own in the forest
      of Cove where she finally reached the Cove Militia's barracks. Although Mela
      loved it in the barrack's she found it hard to communicate with adult's because
      of her past experience and it resulted in her becoming injured and all of
      her past memory wiped out. Mela now lives with who she believes is her father,
      Locke, ex woad raider from the Celts of Kallahar.
