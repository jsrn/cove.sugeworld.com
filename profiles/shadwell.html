      <B>Appearance</B><BR>
      Shadwell is of average height but quite broad. His face is covered with scars
      a particulair large on his left cheek still looks rather fresh. His armour
      is clean and his weapons are well kept. When running you will notice that
      he pulls slightly with his right leg.
      <P>
      <B>Personality</B><BR>
      Shadwell is a dedicated avatarian and his duties come first, it's his life.
      When off duty he tends to hang in pubs and join in the occasional brawl.
      He has no love for war but he will not turn his back on a good fight. Shadwell
      believes in the system of discipline and honour, he will openly dislike mages
      and have respect for his brothers in arms.
      <P>
      <B>Background</B><BR>
      Shadwell was born in Cove. His father was an average blacksmith with a slight
      drinking problem this quickly became a big drinking problem after Shadwell's
      mother died when he was 12. Growing up with the extra care of three smaller
      brothers Shadwell had to find a way to get extra gold. He became a thug for
      a small band in the forests arround Vesper. Here he learned his skill with
      the bow and kryss. Cove was a place of chaos and bussines was good for Shad.
      <P>
      When the band broke into a small farm close to Cove, the leader ordered the
      death of a peasant who refused to tell where he had hidden his gold. Shad
      killed the leader instead and went back home. Helping his father through
      the last days of his life Shadwell noticed that things were changing, a baron
      began to establish himself in Cove and law returned.
      <P>
      Just before the Orcs invaded Cove a man clad in black and brown entered his
      house, he introduced himself as Thom and he served the Baron. He knew about
      Shadwell's criminal past and gave him a chance to get his life back on tracks.
      <P>
      Join the Covian guard he said.<BR>
      And so he did.
