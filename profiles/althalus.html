      <B>History</B><BR>
      Me, ma and pa were merchants of a poor sort so they did travel the less known
      routes to make the coppers rich, and as a child I were dragged to many places
      far and wide and many strange things I have seen... but always Cove has been
      me home and back here I be! I have a few tricks I picked up off of some funny
      foreign sorts and a few talents of the sneaky nature but rest assured they
      shall only be employed in the service of Cove!
