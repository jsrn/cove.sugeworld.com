      <B>Name: </B>Simply Sir Hugo to most, but his actual name is Sir Hugo of
      Rothermere.<BR>
      <B>Age: </B>Hard to tell, but around his fifties.<BR>
      <B>Gender: </B>Male
      <P>
      <B>Appearance<BR>
      </B>Hugo is quite tall, but this is amplified by his aura. He has a finely
      trimmed vandyke, and long hair. His armour is engraved and he wears an ancient
      seal upon his surcoat. Around his belt he almost always carries a copy of
      the scriptures. His favoured weapon is his huge warhammer which he affectionately
      refers to as "the bane of infidels".
      <P>
      <B>History<BR>
      </B>Hugo was the son of another knight, and the descended from the founder
      of the Covian knight order.<BR>
      Hugo's mother was slain by Drow's not long after he was born and as such
      he never got to know his mother. His father brought him up in a very strict
      manner, and as such Hugo is mostly cold and to the point. He is a veteran
      of many battles, and know's his foes quite well. Although he strives for
      a better world, he live's very much by the statement "the end's justify the
      means." He is currently working to rebuild his order that was smashed when
      Orc's invaded and occupied Cove. <BR>
