            Formerly known as the Great Covian Army, the Company
            consists of battle hardened, full time regular soldiers. The Baron's personal 
            fighting force, they man the walls of Cove and make sure the citizens are not
            bothered in their daily work by monsters or criminals, while also being involved 
            in work outside of their own borders, for a little coin, of course... The Baron 
            holds the loyalty of the Company with an iron fist, employing his officers 
            to execute extreme discipline and dealing out harsh punishment upon any failure.

                        and, thus, must endure a tough life to succeed in earning the respect of their superiors.

                        Recruits; guiding them through the recruiting process and ensuring
                        that there is work to do. At this level, Mercenaries are also expected
                        to regularly draft up reports on their many duties and adventures.
