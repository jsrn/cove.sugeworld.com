      <TD width="600">Welcome to Covian Intrigue, the unknown sect of the Baronship
	of Cove, an Out Of Character (OOC) means to giving the overall project
	definition, focus, and purpose.<BR>
	<BR>
	  <HR>
	<B><U>The Baron's Return</U></B><BR>
	Baron Octiovus sat at his old desk. <BR>
	The hour was late, and the candles flickered as Octiovus von Richter of Cove,
	the Lord that had deserted his land and his people in their time of need,
	studied a few simple parchments on the day's affairs of the Baronship Household.
	<BR>
	Octiovus grew weary, and was ready to retire to his bedside.. but a faint
	noise raised him from his slumbering mind. He looked over to the balcony
	to see a man dressed in simple clothing, and a long drawn cloak. He looked
	aged and worn, and with a dark intent in mind. Clutching a dagger in his
	right hand, Gregor Eason, former Commander of the Cove Militia, stood facing
	the Baron. Having distanced himself from Cove following a devastating defeat
	at his own command, Gregor took a stern look at Octiovus.<BR>
	"I thought you had left." The Baron suggested. <BR>
	"And I the same of ye. Welcome back, thy lordship. I trust ye stay in Yew
	was a pleasant one. Betraying one's plague infested land for another that
	is without such disease must truly be the high life of Nobility." Gregor's
	presence this eve was all too clear. Revenge was the matter at heart. Revenge
	for the people of Cove, who's lord had left them to rot in disease and ill
	health, only to join the very Enemy he had sworn to defeat. "Well then. Let's
	make this quick shall we? Any last words, BARON Octiovus?" The former Covian
	officer raised his dagger.<BR>
	"Just the Truth, Eason. Just the Truth."
	<P>
	The Baron let out a long sigh, and looked downward. "My departure from this
	land. My apparent 'betrayal'. It was not meant to be." Gregor stared blankly
	at the Baron. "I had no choice... Listen well, Gregor. Listen well.&nbsp;I
	am going to tell you everything."<BR>
	<BR>
	"During your absence as you&nbsp;know full well, the deadly plague known
	as the 'Green Death' took a hold of Cove. Within days the disease had spread
	faster than most of our Healers would have imagined. Our attempts at isolating
	the epidemic failed disastrously. We were without hope. Local physicians
	and alchemists had nay idea of the disease they were dealing with, least
	of all.. how to cure such evil. <BR>
	However, late one eve.. when I&nbsp;was sat here just like this.. a man stepped
	forth from the shadows and startled me! So much for&nbsp;Grenadier security,
	hmm?"<BR>
	"Get to the point." Gregor spoke through gritted teeth. <BR>
	"A Yew Waywatcher. One can recognise so easily from their garments, when
	they are visible of course. He offered assistance directly from Lord Klion
	D'Gar, an aid no other could.. the cure for the Green Death." The Baron drew
	his eyes away. "I left.. in exchange for the antidote." <BR>
	"That's nonsense." Gregor protested. "Cove recovered the cure for the Plague.
	I saw it myself. Squads led by Officer Cadets Drachir and Valentine retrieved
	it from a compounder in Ilshenar." <BR>
	"Where did ye unravel the location of this compounder from?" The Baron
	smirked.<BR>
	"Who.. Chaismene Volte. A lady... from Yew.." Octiovus nodded. <BR>
	"Beginning to understand?" <BR>
	"She would not betray us by liasing with the Enemy!" Gregor was visibly
	disturbed, but the Baron merely chuckled.<BR>
	"Of course not! She is quite the faithful one. Fear nay, Gregor. The simple
	knowledge of the compounder's whereabouts was snitched across Yew worse than
	rumours of Calico Kate's infamous cheating on Ryan Greystone!" The Baron
	continued to chuckle, but Gregor remained unamused.<BR>
	"We would have found the compounder ourselves..." <BR>
	"The compounder was of Yew." The Baron interrupted.. "Return to Ilshenar,
	I trust ye will not find him there."<BR>
	<BR>
	The story.. though hard to hear.. made sense. The cure had nay been retrieved
	until the Baron had gone, and all guardsmen knew of the search efforts made
	before then. Gregor Eason weighed his thoughts.<BR>
	"If this is true, Baron Octiovus. Why were ye so destructful and bitter.
	It seemed that ye were making thy own decisions..." Octiovus looked at Gregor
	oddly.<BR>
	"Come now... Gregor Eason... Of all Covians, I thought Ye at least would
	know. I am never a loser in Britannia, my dear fellow. I was nay going to
	surrender publicly to that bastard D'Gar. I made it all seem as if t'was
	my choice so that my public image was retained; wealthy and powerful. The
	wealth! Well.. the wealth is always nearby. But the power, Eason. The power..
	Something perhaps ye've nay understood yet, hmm? If I were to surrender myself
	to Yew, what good would that do me?" <BR>
	"You miserable bastard." Gregor barked.&nbsp;"Its always about YOU." The
	Baron stared back viciously.<BR>
	"I'd take kindly of thy words, Gregor. My actions prevented the Covian people
	from their own extinction. Had I nay left and gone to Yew, the Green Death
	would have obliterated the populus. You, yourself, would nay be standing
	here. So let's talk about me, shall we? How ruthless and careless toward
	my own people I am??" Gregor inhaled deeply.<BR>
	"Ye should have told me."<BR>
	"YOU.. were not here. WERE YOU?!" Both men, now equally frustrated, had seemingly
	hit a wall in the argument. Gregor lowered his dagger. <BR>
	"The Grenadiers..." Gregor paused. "They.. knew?"<BR>
	"Wouldn't be the Baron's Own if they didn't." Octiovus winked. "Oh come now,
	Gregor. The hour is late. We have both exchanged the affairs of the matter.
	Must I go on?" Gregor muttered, and shook his head. "Good! Here. Have a brandy."
	The Baron casually strolled over to his drinks cabinet, opened a bottle,
	and poured some of the good stuff into two glasses. Offering a glass to Gregor,
	he quizzed.. "So.. this business of resigning your Commission. Better than
	dying on us again I suppose!" The Baron and the former Commander clinked
	glasses together, and drank down a hearty amount. "When did ye leave the
	Militia?"<BR>
	<BR>
	"I never left." The Baron raised his eyebrow, only to be returned with a
	grin from the supposedly inactive Covian officer.

	      The Assault Pioneers are naturally the toughest guardsmen in the Guard. They
	      represent the iron will of Cove, and are chosen through rigourous and demanding
	      selection courses. <BR>
	      Assault Pioneers are walking fortresses. They possess strength and dexterity
	      that is unmatched, and it is this high physical tolerance that enables them
	      to withstand the most awesome of attacks. <BR>
	      Though slow and bulky in movement, the Assault Pioneers are the core of any
	      battle - and will lead the way for all Covian guardsmen - to the end, unto
	      death. <BR>

	      * Purchasing new Ships, and Packhorses!<BR>
	      * If one rises from a Small to a Large Business, and conquers the merchants
	      of Cove.. what is to say one might begin their own "Company".. owning a vast
	      network of Businesses! Surely Nobility will follow!<BR>

	      Not to spoil the party completely, but this is a new concept.. And if it
	      is felt that a Business has risen FAR too quickly through a means that is
	      questionable, the Emergency Tax policy shall put into swing.. and shall cut
	      nearly 50% from the Business!<BR>
