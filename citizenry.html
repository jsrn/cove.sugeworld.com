While Cove hosts a thriving and powerful Army, it could not survive without the citizens that they protect. While
there is a large immigration rate into Cove, the bulk of citizens are from Cove Proper, and the surrounding shire.
<br><br>
The citizens of Cove perform all the vital roles. They make Cove a bustling town full of traders, peddlers, craftsman,
merchants, ruffians, scoundrels, pilferers, pickpockets, people of leisure, people of adventure, rich people, poor
people and people from every other walk of life!
