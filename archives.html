		    <U><B>The Good Will Of Sir Nicholas<BR>
		    </B></U> A short story that took place during a hard Covian winter, leaving
		    the Folk Tale House tavern without ale, and thus the season without merry.
		    <BR>
		    However, the cunning of Sir Nicholas saw the drinks delivered, and the festive
		    season saved!<BR>

		    The tragic end of Cove's first Commander. Having been connected to supporting
		    and coordinating efforts toward the Yew rebellion, the Guardsmen Militia
		    crashed the Commander's retirement party in a rather soppy way. <BR>

		    Throughout the Kaldorian Conflict, various journals were kept by the Commander
		    of the Cove Militia. A few jots and scribblings are all that remains, but
		    the writing depicts the horror and brutality of the war against Kaldor.<BR>

		    Cove's first and, arguably, greatest victory! During the early rising of
		    the Baronship of Cove, its City was corrupted and occupied by a mass horde
		    of Orcs. <BR>
		    For many months the Covian guardsmen battled this threat, and t'was not until
		    a vast army marched from Britain, that Cove was liberated from its captor!<BR>
