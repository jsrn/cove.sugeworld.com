      <I>Written by Junior Guardsman Ryan Greystone: 18th February 2005</I><BR
	  />
      <BR />
      <I>Em nay believed meh&#133; why wouldn&#145;t em believe me? I&#133; I saw
      it with meh own eyes I did.</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Looking up while cleaning a dirty glass the bartender raised his left
      brow*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Ye alright there lad? I normaly can&#145;t get ye to shut up and now
      ye&#145;ve been staring down at that ale for more then thirty minutes mumbling
      to yerself.</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Looking up from his ale Ryan stared at the bartender for a good long time
      before lowering his head again and sighing deeply*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Even if I did tell ye&#133; ye&#145;d probably nay believe meh anyway..
      Its nay like any of em others believed meh.<BR />
      I tell ye em all thought I was jokin&#145;! But &#145;e was possessed! I
      saw it with meh own eyes! I swear that it &#145;appened!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Nodding slowly the bartender approached Ryan and leaned on the bar in front
      of him* <BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Well&#133; how about ye tell me yer story and I&#145;ll make up me own
      mind and see if I believe ye eh? It can&#145;t be stranger then some of them
      other stories I hear around here.. I mean this one fellow said he burp up
      whole fishes! Spend twenty minutes burping at me bar he did.. But uhhh..&nbsp;
      that&#146;s another story so how about it lad? Care to tell me?</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Looking around Ryan signed and nodded faintly*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>A..alroit then I&#145;ll tell ye but I&#145;m pretty sure ye&#145;ll nay
      believe what I have to tell ye.<BR />
      <BR />
      Ye see it all started yesterday when we &#145;ad to gather at the barracks
      since miss Donwin was planning some sort of mystery trip somewhere.<BR />
      Well when we were all standing in front of em barracks she started to &#146;and
      out these &#146;ere fur cloaks and boots.. It seemed that we were
      &#146;eadin&#146; towards some cave located on an island made out of ice..
      Did I ever tell ye I &#146;ate cold?! I mean.. bloodi &#146;ell the second
      we were there I was already freezin&#146; meh arse off.<BR />
      <BR />
      Now that cold wasn&#145;t the worst thin&#145; that &#145;appened&#133; the
      really crazy things started &#145;appenin&#145; when we entered that
      cave.<BR />
      Everythin&#145; was fine in the start.. There were a few deadies around but
      we &#145;ad nay problem whackin&#145; em and we really &#145;ad a good time
      in there&#133; until we came to this &#145;ere meetin&#145; room or
      somethin&#145;</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *The bartender chuckled loudly and rubbed his bald head*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Meeting room eh?! Were the deadies having a tea party there or something?
      Ho Ho Ho!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Ryan slammed his hand down on the bar and growled loudly at the
      bartender*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Ye think this &#145;ere story be a joke?! I tell ye it was bloodi scary!
      I &#145;ave &#145;ad many scary things &#145;appen in meh life but this one
      &#145;ere probably beats em all!<BR />
      <BR />
      As I was sayin&#145; it all started goin&#145; wron&#145; when we entered
      that there meetin&#145; room.. And nay there were nay deadies &#145;oldin&#145;
      a tea party.<BR />
      The whole room was empty and everythin&#145; was fine until the captain sat
      down on this &#145;ere stone chair.. Nothing&#145; &#145;append in the start
      until &#145;e jumped out of the chair screamin&#145; like somebody stabbed
      a sword in &#145;is arse.<BR />
      <BR />
      Well it was nay a sword but there were snakes crawlin&#145; out of &#145;oles
      of the bottom of the chair! We all left that there room as quickly as we
      could but the captain suddenly stopped movin&#145; after we left it.. Meh
      bein&#145; the captains torch &#145;older&#133; well I was forced to stick
      around with &#145;im while em others were goin&#145; deeper into that there
      place.<BR />
      <BR />
      I tried to wake the captain up but all &#145;e did was just stare at meh
      like some mindless creature.. Well.. Lookin&#145; back I wish he just kept
      doin&#145; that because what &#145;e did afterwards was a &#145;ell of a
      lot worse!</I><BR />
      *The bartender sniggered faintly and started rubbing the piece of cloth in
      his hand over the surface of the wooden bar*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Staring at ye like a mindless creature eh..? Reminds me of old bob is
      does! That old eijit but kept staring at me like some love drunk fool he
      did.. Uuhh&#133; well who knows maybe yer captain just has a crush on ye
      eh..? Ho Ho Ho!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Ryan narrows his eyed at the bartender and grumbled quietly*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Oh aye..? Would somebody who &#145;ad a crush on meh try and cut meh
      &#145;ead off with &#145;is axe?<BR />
      After a while &#145;e started ramblin&#145; about somethin&#145; called a
      black wizard and how my punishment fer enterin&#145; &#145;is realm was death..
      Well &#145;e just threw himself at meh and tried to whack meh &#145;e
      did!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img239.exs.cx/img239/2846/evil18sz.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Well thank the avatar I was able to &#145;old &#145;im off fer a while
      because &#145;e suddenly changed back to normal.. And wouldn&#145;t ye believe
      it.. &#145;e acted like nothin&#145; ever &#145;appened! And even after I
      told &#145;im &#145;e thought I was jokin&#145;</I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img239.exs.cx/img239/7886/evil27aa.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Well.. I already &#145;ad a very bad feelin&#145; about that there place
      but we just kept on goin&#145; since the captain wanted to catch up with
      &#145;is group&#133; after around ten minutes of nothin&#145;
      &#145;appenin&#145; I thought it was all over that the captain &#145;ad turned
      back to normal.<BR />
      <BR />
      But then all of the sudden this &#145;ere creepy voice starts echoin&#145;
      through em &#145;alls tellin&#146; meh I would nay leave that there place
      alive.. Well if it was up to meh I would &#146;ave gotten meh arse out of
      there roit then! The that bloodi captain was actin&#146; like I was playin&#146;
      games with &#146;im! Well I sure as &#146;ell was nay laughin&#146; about
      it!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img239.exs.cx/img239/6880/evil30om.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      *The bartender shook his head and chuckled loudly*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Ahhh poor lad! Yer captain was probably trying to play a trick on ye!
      I mean back in my service days the always did something like that to scare
      the hell out of the new recruits.. Made you a man it did! Or so they
      said.</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Grumbling faintly Ryan shook his head*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>That&#146;s what I thought in the start as well&#133; but more and more
      of em strange things started &#145;appenin&#145; there were voices comin&#145;
      from all sorts of directions and this &#145;ere whisper kept callin&#145;
      in meh &#145;ead that we were goin&#145; to die a &#145;orrible death if
      we were going to go any deeper.<BR />
      <BR />
      Well.. I tried ignorin&#145; em voices inside meh &#145;ead fer as lon&#145;
      as em kept on goin&#145; but all of the sudden blood start flowin&#146; down
      em walls! Real blood I tell ye! And lots of it too! </I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img239.exs.cx/img239/7988/evil47yd.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      <I>I tried talkin&#145; some sense into the captain and make &#145;im leave
      that there place.. I mean the other group was about triple our size in men
      and I was nay plannin&#145; on gettin&#145; meself killed in that stinkin&#145;
      frosty crypt!<BR />
      <BR />
      But what do ye think that captain does..? &#145;E just frowns at meh and
      tells meh to cut out the jokes! I swear I was goin&#145; to grab meh axe
      and personally cut &#145;is &#145;ead off meself at that point! Lucky fer
      &#145;im one of em other recruits walked in that moment because I tell ye
      I would &#145;ave done it!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img208.exs.cx/img208/5895/evil57cm.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      *Ryan took a deep breath and shook his head before continuing his story*<BR
	  />
      <BR />
      <I>Well&#133; we were about to go further into that there place but all of
      the sudden this &#145;ere bright red light started showin&#145; from under
      the captains &#145;elmet.. Well.. I thought what any other common man would
      &#145;ave thought.. &#145;is &#145;ead must &#145;ave been on fire!<BR />
      As soon as I told &#145;im &#145;is &#145;ead was on fire &#145;e pulled
      off &#145;is &#145;elmet and well.. Err&#133; it was nay fire I tell ye but
      that was this &#145;ere weird red light comin&#145; from &#145;is eyes and
      they were bleedin&#145;! bleedin&#145; I tell ye!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img208.exs.cx/img208/3830/evil61xh.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      *The bartender rubbed his chin and looked down at Ryan*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Bleeding eyes eh..? My brother in law had that once.. Too many carrots
      I tell ye! He was always eating them all day long and wouldn&#145;t ye know
      it.. One day he suddenly stabs himself in the eye with a carrot!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Ryan stared blankly at the bartender for a while before nodding slowly*<BR
	  />
      <BR />
      <I>R&#133;roit&#133; uhh.. Well em were nay carrots I tell ye.. Somethin&#145;
      must &#145;ave possessed &#145;im because all of the sudden &#146;e was
      actin&#146; all strange like &#146;e did before!<BR />
      He started to talk to meh in this &#146;ere creepy voice about &#146;ow &#146;e
      was goin&#146; to kill meh and meh captain&#133; So I told ye! &#146;E was
      possessed! Why else would &#146;e want to finish &#146;imself off eh
      eh..?<BR />
      <BR />
      Anyway&#133; if ye thought them bleedin&#146; eyes were scary.. Ye should
      &#146;ave seen what &#146;appened next.. All of the sudden this &#146;ere
      bright white light came out from under &#146;is &#146;elmet and &#146;e tossed
      &#146;is axe towards meh!<BR />
      It almost &#146;it meh in the &#146;ead too it did! But err&#133; well I
      sort of blacked out after that&#133; so uhmm&#133; w.well.. Uhh..
      Ahem!</I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img208.exs.cx/img208/7342/evil73oq.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      *The bartender stared at Ryan for a while and smirked faintly*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Ye fainted eh lad..? Ho ho ho! <BR />
      <BR />
      Don&#146;t worry about it lad! It happened to everyone once in their life
      it does&#133; and to ye it happened after yer captains head turned into a
      torch.</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Sighing heavily Ryan looked up at the widely grinning bartender*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>&#146;Is &#145;ead nay turned into a torch ye eijit&#133; It must &#145;ave
      been some sort of wytchy light!<BR />
      <BR />
      Anyway where was I again..? Uhh&#133; oh aye.. I just woke up and the captain
      was lookin&#146; down at meh&#133; but fer some reason &#146;e nay longer
      &#146;ad that there wytchy light.. &#146;e just kept on ramblin&#146; about
      meh bein&#146; a pansy and &#146;avin&#146; to find the group&#133; up to
      this &#146;ere day I still nay know what the &#146;ell &#146;appened to &#146;im
      down there since after that &#146;e was back to normal&#133; &#146;e nay
      tried to kill meh anymore or whatever&#133; &#146;e just wanted us to go
      in deeper in that there place.. <BR />
      <BR />
      Well&#133; I told ye the captain was back to normal but I still &#146;eard
      em voices! They were soundin&#146; really bloodi &#146;appy about the captains
      decision about goin&#146; deeper into that there place&#133; but even after
      all meh pleadin&#146; that eijit still ordered us to go deeper into that
      there place. </I><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img143.exs.cx/img143/6536/evil83os.jpg" alt="" border="0"
	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      <I>I swear things were real down there&#133; but after a while we ran into
      the group and em voices stopped completely.. I tried to tell everybody what
      the &#145;ell &#145;appened down there but nobody would even believe meh!
      Em just laughed and kept on walkin&#145; like I was some sort of madman!
      <BR />
      <BR />
      Well&#133; At least Gimbly believed meh because I know what I saw was real!
      I just know it fer sure!</I><BR />
      <BR />

	  /><BR />
      <BR />
      *The bartender stared down at Ryan and while nodding slowly he removed the
      ale bottle which was standing next to Ryan*<BR />
      <I>Uhh&#133; I think ye had enough of this fer one day lad&#133; a very nice
      story indeed but I be afraid I&#145;ll have to agree with them other folk..
      Ye lost yer marbles lad! Now go home and get yerself some rest because ye
      look like a broken man.</I><BR />
      <BR />
      *Sighing heavily Ryan stood up from his stool and walked towards the
      door*<BR />
      <BR />
      <I>Why won&#145;t they believe meh..? Nobody believes meh&#133;</I>
