	      2005 - Surprise Attack from Kaldor!</U></B></FONT><BR>
	      In a grim counter attack of recent Covian offensives against Trinsic, the
	      Army of Kaldor and members of the House Von'Sah employed surprise tactics
	      in a massive assault upon the Cove Barracks this eve.<BR>
	      Nay many escaped without wound, as the Kaldorians and Drow mercilessly swept
	      through the Barracks, knocking down Militia, Hospitaller, Templar, and citizen
	      alike. Some wonder as to which road this new offensive against Cove may lead,
	      but others are certain; it shall lead to war.

	      <I>Rumours are that the information Dashel Dellalany held (under the false

	      Militia Scouts traced a lead that Dashel Dellalany (under the false name
	      of Jarneal), father of Dellamona, was being held captive at the Yew Mill,
	      in the northern lands of Britannia. <BR>
	      A squad of Covians led by Sergeant Gry marched up to Yew and stood at arms,
	      outside the Mill. They addressed strange folk wearing unnatural garb, but
	      folk that seemed to be recognised from the skirmish in the Britain Sewers
	      not a&nbsp;few days before, when Dashel was first kidnapped. The strange
	      folk spoke of Dashel being already dead, but the veteran Sergeant would accept
	      none of that, and saw that the brigands were felled, and the Mill searched.
	      However, there was no trace of Dashel to be found.<BR>
	      Has the father of Dellamona been killed? What important information did he
	      hold?

	      <B><U>Thursday, 20th January 2005 - Rescue Attempt Thwarted!</U></B><BR>
	      A squad of Covian guardsmen escorted Miss Dellamona on personal business
	      in Britain this eve. There, she met with an old friend who directed her to
	      the Britain Sewers, where Dashel Dellalany (Dellamona's father) was taking
	      refuge. The reason as&nbsp;to why he was hiding beneath ground? It is
	      unknown.<BR>
	      Upon arrival to the Sewers, and a wide search of the undergound, the man
	      was located protected by an armed guard of thugs. It seemed he was being
	      held hostage, and a duel was undertaken between Sergeant Gry, the Militia
	      officer present at the scene, and the leader of the brigands; the prize of
	      the victor being the claim to Dashel, of course. Suspense was held high during
	      the duel, however, the battle hardened Militia Sergeant professionally dispatched
	      the brigand; and all others fled, one making a pass at the captive, leaving
	      a shallow wound around the neck.
	      <P>

	      <P>
	      Dashel had been freed, and rescued by the Cove Militia; with Dellamona quickly
	      seeing to her father, hugging him, beset with emotion. Dashel spoke to Della
	      quickly, informing of the need to reach safe and protected borders, where
	      important information could be spoken without fear of it being heard by the
	      "wrong" ears. The Militia guardsmen quickly prompted the two forward, aiming
	      to make for the exit passage from the Sewers back to Britain. However, nearing
	      the exit the Militia were set upon by warriors clad in black; so black that
	      they could only just be seen. The Militia escort was overwhelmed by the surprise
	      assault, and was quickly taken out of action.<BR>
	      Dellamona's father was captured, and taken away. Where to? No one knows.
	      And the information he held, that which was of great importance, remains
	      unheard.

	      Just when ye thought our gracious town was safe, it comes under attack from
	      the despicable Drow. Several of these creatures plagued the streets of Cove
	      this eve, but were met in force by Militia guardsmen and Knights Hospitallers.
	      The Drow attackers were chased off quickly, and some were felled. No doubt
	      these offensive actions toward Cove shall lead the Baronship to constitute
	      a state of war against the Drow Houses, and against any who stand in the
	      way of their being brought to Justice.

	      Last eve, a handful of Covian guardsmen successfully escorted a caravan full

	      The caravan was hindered many times by local brigands and monsters, but the
	      stern protection that the Militia provided ensured that nay one drop of these

	      Trinsic!</U></B><BR>
	      This evening the Covian Church, personified by Knight Captain Hugo, lead
	      guardsmen, mercenaries, and citizens of Cove to the city of Trinsic in an
	      aggressive move against the Drow infidels taking refuge there. The Covian
	      forces were joined by a most mysterious cult also, known only as the Black
	      Drake Syndicate.<BR>
	      On moving into Trinsic, the force seemed confident and in control. The Knight
	      Captain Hugo spoke fiercely to the authorities of Trinsic on the matter that
	      harbouring infidels was a most evil act. It was not long till a Drow was
	      sighted, and the force took quickly to engaging the unsacred creature.<BR>
	      However... victory was not for the taking. Cunning tactics employed by several
	      rogue Drow and a squad of battle hardened Kaldorians saw the entire crusading
	      party vanquished. And so, the Covians and other folk were driven back. Perhaps
	      next time they would be more successful in their religious cleansing of the
	      Drow.

	      undrinkable. The&nbsp;group was led by Barbara of the "Knights and Mages
	      of Kha (KMK)" upstream towards Minoc, where it came across a suspicious miner's
	      encampment. Several men stationed there were questioned, and their belongings
	      searched. <BR>
	      After a considerable amount of talking and debate, the group finally discovered
	      the truth behind the polluted waters of Vesper. It appears that the miners
	      had been using a solution known as "Quicksilver" to convert copper ore into
	      gold, making for quite a profitable business. The excess of the solution
	      was washed off into the river, becoming an infamous white foam, which then
	      floated downstream. <BR>
	      The matter has now been resolved with the miners, and it is believed that
	      the Vesperian waters will be clean and drinkable again within a few days.
	      The water crisis is over. Huzzah!<BR>

	      Cove!</U></B><BR>
	      This evening, the Cove Militia made an assault upon the walls of its beloved
	      town; a successful offensive upon the occupying Orc horde. Cove itself remains
	      dominated by the horde, which includes hundreds of Orc Brutes and Magi; all
	      proving extremely tough adversaries for the Covian guardsmen. However, the
	      Militia managed to penetrate the Orc defences and successfully capture the
	      walls of Cove. While this victory could only be short lived it no doubt has
	      made a firm dent in the Orc morale, and has shown the citizens of nearby
	      lands that the Cove Militia are winning the battles, and soon they will be
	      winning the war.<BR>

	      Yiveth, the barwench of the infamous Swagger's Inn, has been elected by the

	      Being exiled from its home, the Baronship of Cove has taken up new residence
	      in a glorious stronghold close to the heart of the Vesperian community. It
	      is said that the Baron is "most pleased" with this recent acquirement. The
	      stronghold contains two floors; the bottom floor is to be Baron Octiovus'
	      office and the miltia's work area, whilst the top floor remains strictly
	      the Baron's private quarters. The stronghold is situated directly south from
	      the Buccaneer's Den gate.

	      Since the apparent death of Lord Kain Twothumb Vesper has been out of control.
	      The law, which states that the title and power of Lord Protector was to be
	      given to Twothumb's spouse (Tae'nu'Ver) in his absence or death, has been
	      rejected by the Council of Vesper. The Council has instead removed Tae'nu'Ver
	      from her position and announced Garret of the Vesper Trading Company as the
	      new Lord Protector of Vesper. Garret's placement however is only temporary
	      until the next Lord Protector election. Feuds have erupted, the peace of
	      Vesper has been broken, and the Acting Lord Protector's life is already in
	      danger.<BR>

	      There are reports emerging that the Lord Protector Twothumb has been killed
	      following the collapse of his residence in Vesper. A large bang was heard
	      yesterday evening alerting citizens nearby to witness the destruction of
	      the Lord's house, which also contained vital water supplies for the Vesper
	      community. The wreckage is still being searched for the body of Lord Twothumb.
	      Is the Lord Protector really dead? Who will take position of Acting Lord
	      Protector? More news to come as the story unfolds.<BR>
