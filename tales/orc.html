	    <U>7th January 2005: Commander's Log - Gregor Eason</U><BR>
	    After many nights planning offensive tactics, seeing to the wounded, praising
	    the dead, we can finally know peace. Late this evening, Cove was liberated
	    by an army of Britannians, alongside Cove Militia and angry citizens. It
	    was a sight that I shall remember for the rest of my days. So many had answered
	    the call to arms, so many. The Orcs were completely overwhelmed by the attacking
	    force; even the Ogre Lords that were guarding the Baron's north tower could
	    not defend against the assault. A grand victory, indeed.<BR>
	    And so, our campaign against the Orc horde ends. Victory is ours. Cove is
	    free. The homeless may return. We can, at last, have some rest.
	    <P>
	    <U>4th January 2005</U><BR>
	    It appears our efforts against the Orc horde have been rewarded. The two
	    wealthy merchants, Aldo Purehands and Whispering Green, have selected the
	    Baronship as the guild with the most aggressive activity against the force
	    occupying Cove; and has presented a Stronghold with many resources that can
	    be used in our campaign against the Orcs. This brings much celebration to
	    the hearts of the citizens and guardsmen of the Baronship, who long have
	    fought hard for the freedom of Cove.
	    <P>
	    <U>28th December 2004</U><BR>
	    Until this day, our actions against the Orc horde have not been documented.
	    But, I feel the need for a journal to be kept in these dark times. Not so
	    that we may count our dead, nor consider our casulties, but so that we may
	    recognise our success, and reward our valor. The Orcs are beginning to learn
	    a very important lesson; Fear.<BR>
	    The more they fear, the weaker they grow. Just as the Mysterious Figure said
	    that night we were 'visited', "If you show the perserverance you have shown
	    here, I am sure Cove will be free one day."<BR>
	    Those words I take with me into my heart, on the blacker days of our Campaign
	    against the Orcs.
