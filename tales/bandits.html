	    </A> <B>Petty Thief</B><BR>
	    The lowest of the low, the Petty Thief is something of an urchin in the criminal
	    underworld. They are mistreated rejects of the Law biding society, and general
	    ill do'ers seeking to make a career out of crime. Though only young and thick
	    headed, the Petty Thief can show considerable resourcefulness and cunning,
	    developed from a hard childhood living in the rough or on the streets.
	    <P>
	    <U>Requirements</U><BR>
	    * Basic roleplaying skills. <BR>
	    * Understanding of the Bandit concept.
	    <P>
	    <B>Thug</B><BR>
	    The Thugs are the most common criminals to be seen. They have found luck
	    in their profession that has led them to gaining some new found respect from
	    their peers. However, this climb in notoreity has not been great, and they
	    still have some distance to go on their path to becoming rich and feared.<BR>
	    Thugs are likely to be snatched by their superiors; more respected and powerful
	    Bandits who work as underdogs for the local Boss. As lackeys, Thugs are often
	    sent on dangerous errands by Bandits, doing the dirty work, and are most
	    likely to be the first &nbsp;to be caught and hanged.
	    <P>
	    <U>Requirements</U><BR>
	    * Good, active mischief.
	    <P>
	    <B>Bandit</B><BR>
	    Bandits are long standing criminals with reputation. They have made a name
	    for themselves, and are no doubt being eyed by the local Boss as potential
	    allies (or enemies...). Having worked their way up from Petty Thieves, Bandits
	    have a rogue sense of their surroundings, and have a keen eye for opportunities
	    in gaining riches. <BR>
	    A street smart attitude aids the&nbsp;Bandits in remaining at large, enabling
	    them to further develop their power and notoreity.
	    <P>
	    <U>Requirements</U><BR>
	    * Good, active mischief.<BR>
	    * Showing enthusiasm for the Bandit concept.
	    <P>
	    <B>Gang Boss</B><BR>
	    The Gang Boss is the ring leader of the criminal underworld. With Cove being
	    but a small town, there is only one Boss at any time. He/she must extensively
	    apply brutish power to ensure that criminals "know who's Boss", and do not
	    attempt to claim the top spot through force. <BR>
	    The Gang Boss organises the rogues in various networks of crime related projects,
	    which can include smuggling, ransom, assassinations, poison trading, bribery,
	    gambling dens, robbery, and so on.
	    <P>
	    <U>Requirements</U><BR>
	    * Long standing mischievous activity.<BR>
	    * Good understanding and enthuisasm for the Bandit conncept.<BR>
	    * Good organisational and event creations skills.
	    <P>
	    <A name="role"><U><B><BIG>Role</BIG></B></U><BR>
	    </A> Bandits exist in the community of Cove to provide an internal enemy
	    for the Baronship citizens and Militia, creating an atmosphere of danger
	    and fear, making even simple tasks such as cutting logs dangerous! The concept
	    also exists to provide opportunities for interaction in times of community
	    inactivity, and a variety of roleplay for guild players.
