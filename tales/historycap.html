      Written by Corporal Althalus, and edited by Commander Eason<BR>
      <BR>
      Long ago in Cove, times were hard and riches were short. The town was frequently
      under attack from many a foul beast, to which the Baron tended to fighting
      himself. There, he stood alone... However, one day he faced an Enemy that
      overwhelmed him in number and in strength. All hope was lost, until one man
      from Cove, a simple farmer, came and stood beside the Baron with nothing
      but a pitchfork. Together, they fought the Enemy and won victory for Cove.<BR>
      With the coffers being slim, the Baron had nothing to offer the farmer for
      his aid, other than the beaten cap he wore upon his head.
      <P>
      Since that day the Militia have proudly worn their headdress, the Covian
      cap; a symbol of loyalty to the Baron, and of His commitment to the Militia.
