	    Eason</U><BR>
	    Ugh! Expected. A vicious counterattack from the Samurai and Kaldorians. Though
	    we were strong in number and fierce in spirit, our lines were broken and
	    the Barracks seized by the emerald army. However, the force nay led behind
	    an occupation garrison... They moved onto Cove, boasted their victory, and
	    then set sail..? I cannot understand why they took not the town. My only
	    thoughts are that this conflict has become too expensive for the Kaldorians,
	    what with their many lands to protect and their soldiers to feed. Perhaps
	    the legendary warriors have... lost... interest?
	    <P>
	    <U>13th April 2005: Commander's Report - Gregor Eason</U><BR>
	    Finally, a Victory. We were lucky. The intelligence reports attained were
	    correct. Kaldorians were few in number. But nevertheless, a victory; something
	    excellent for the Covian morale. With Commander Soulshadow in captivity in
	    a secret location, I feel we have some leverage in this war. Who knows...
	    Maybe we can negotiate for the Kaldorians to lay down their arms and turn
	    tail?...<BR>
	    Ha! Never. We'd release Soulshadow only to see her knocking at the gates
	    again, with an army of a thousand soldiers. Mmm...<BR>
	    We'll see where this goes. For now, I am tired from battle.
	    <P>
	    <U>9th April 2005: Commander's Report - Gregor Eason</U><BR>
	    Butchers! We've been thrown out of our town! Damn it!! I return to Cove to
	    find it occupied by Kaldorian soldiers, and Samurai who wish to claim it
	    for themselves. Oh, this will not do. This will NOT do!! We shall retake
	    it damn it!
	    <P>
	    <U>1st April 2005: Commander's Report - Gregor Eason</U><BR>
	    I have only been back a day, and I learn already of Cove being sacked. A
	    mighty battle was fought last eve, one where the Kaldorians and Samurai
	    conequered Covian, Yew, Vesperian, and Hospitaller forces. A truly magnificent
	    victory for them, and a terrible defeat for us.<BR>
	    If Cove is ever to be free again, then we must learn how to fight this Enemy.
	    It is obvious that facing them head on is suicide. We must develop some other
	    form of battle...
	    <P>
	    <U>1st April 2005: Scout's Report - Junior Guardsman Tiolas Amildor</U><BR>
	    This is not good! I was on one of my early patrols around the provinces of
	    Cove, and suddenly it struck me that there were no peasants and traders using
	    the roads! On further investigation I went to our previous battle grounds
	    near one of our guard outposts and was horrified by what I found. The Kaldorians
	    and the crosseyed traitors (Samurai) have blocked off our main road, not
	    letting anyone travel south! <BR>
	    The peasants quickly got word that all who approach the blockade would perhaps
	    not return. Surely we can not let this deed go unpunished. <BR>
	    Also I picked up a few words from a conversation that a Kaldorian was trying
	    to conduct with a crosseye, and it seems their next target would be to destroy
	    our entire town and bring a fall to the Baron of Cove! As they spoke these
	    words I was discovered , and they followed me through the lands until I could
	    hide in a tree somewhere in the woods of Cove...<BR>
	    This is most troubling news! Seeing as our recent battle did not run so smoothly,
	    I believe we need help! And I dont think our Vesperian "friends" will aid
	    us!
	    <P>
	    <U>16th March 2005: Commander's Log - Gregor Eason</U><BR>
	    Again, we find a new Enemy. This time we fight neither orcs, nor bandits,
	    but professional soldiers. The Army of Kaldor has plagued the lands of Britannia
	    for many ages. As an aggressive and well trained force, it has had few defeats.
	    We have already engaged them in battle several times, with victory flourishing
	    only once. Even with its greatest fighters, Cove is struggling to survive
	    against these legendary warriors. Nay doubt we shall have to uncover some
	    new strategy to overcome these Kaldorians.<BR>
	    The Army is lead fearlessly by Commander Cal Soulshadow, my opposite number.
	    Her brutal discipline keeps the Kaldorian soldiers in check; and with a fierce
	    dedication to some War God known as "Raza", these warriors are seemingly
	    without peer.</TD>
