	    <I>The Orc invasion may have been defeated, but from the ashes a new threat
	    arrived; the Bloodeye Orc Tribe. They had one purpose, and that was to take
	    the town of Cove for their own; enslaving its women, and slaughtering and
	    eating its men and children.</I>

	    The role of the Orcs is similar to that of the Bandits', in that it is created
	    as an enemy for the Baronship citizens and Militia. However, with two elements
	    for this purpose it also creates variety in enemy. In addition, the Orc element
	    also allows for the opportunity to roleplay with more evil aligned guilds
	    on a meaningful level.
	    <P>
	    <BIG><U><B>Rules</B></U></BIG><BR>
	    * All Orc characters must be freshly created with a suitable name of Orcish
	    origin (some exceptions in the case of previously existing Orc's will be
	    considered).<BR>
	    * The player must be prepared to learn at least basic black speech mixed
	    with broken English.<BR>
	    * Powergaming on your Orc character is NOT allowed.
