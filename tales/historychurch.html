      </B>Written by Baron Octiovus<BR>
      <BR>
      The Covian church was founded many centuries ago by Keldor of Rothermere.
      He was a zealous man, who many said was bordering on the insane. He made
      it his life's quest to (in his eyes) bring the infidels known as the Covian
      people back onto the path of the Lord and his virtue's. The ruler of Cove
      at the time saw that it'd be easier for him to give Keldor a plot of land
      on which to build his church rather to contend with Keldor...
      <P>
      Keldor built the entire small church himself by hand, and also had two sons;
      one of which was destined to be Head of the Cleric and Priests in Cove, and
      the other to be Keldor's heir and follow in the path of a Knight. <BR>
      It is rumoured that Keldor killed his wife and lover, and went on an ill
      fated crusade to destroy the Chaos shrine where he was overwhelmed by zealots
      of the Dark Lord and killed. However, Keldor's armour was recovered and passed
      down to Ezekiel, the heir which was now in charge of the Covian Knights.<BR>
      Ezekiel spent most of his time recruiting new Knights for the Covian Order,
      and had one heir. It is rumoured that the High Cleric murdered his brother
      for not avenging his father, but officially the Church said he was killed
      by a fanatic assassin of the Dark Lord.
      <P>
      Many generations of crusading and preaching and the armour of Keldor is still
      intact, and worn by the current Church master, Sir Hugo of Rothermere, with
      many engravings of past deeds.<BR>
      Of late, the Covian Church Order has been decimated by the Orc invasion as,
      when Sir Hugo went on his latest crusade against his most hated enemies,
      the Drow's, the Orc's invaded Cove, and killed many of the Church Order as
      they slept. <BR>
      Now only three members of the Order remain; Sir Hugo, his Squire, Jema, and
      Conrad, a Cleric.
      <P>
      But the Covian Church is far from defeated...<BR>
      And thus, it was written:
      <P>
      The Covian church had entered a new era. Recovering now from their loss at
      the hands of the Orcs, people began to believe again; men began to return
      to the Order, and so Sir Hugo decided to begin what he had always aimed for
      - a holy war.<BR>
      Sir Hugo called men to arms. Not only from Cove, but allies from the North.
      And so the first Crusade against the Drow was launched... <BR>
      However, it was not to be. For at the battle outside the gates of Trinsic,
      the "city of Light", Darkness prevailed. The Drow called upon their Kaldorian
      allies and, together, they pushed back the army of Sir Hugo.
      <P>
      But they made one fatal, damning, mistake...<BR>
      ... They had failed to kill Sir Hugo...<BR>
      And now he regains his strength, his faith, and composure; and readies himself
      for a new crusade, a greater one, where victory would be assued.
