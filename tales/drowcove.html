      Written by Knight Errant Mhoram, Knights Hospitallers
      <P>
      Mhoram sat at the table, deep in conversation with Lauranthalas and Rikku.
      Training had been exhausting for all three of them and Mhoram had suggested
      they all retire to his house for rest.
      <P>
      Rest however, was the last thing about to happen. Mhoram jumped a little
      as he noticed a huge eagle sat in the window. It had something tied to its
      foot. Mhoram stood up and walked to the window. As he approached, he recognised
      the eagle belonged to Commander Eason of Cove. This bird was a frequent visitor
      to Lady Donwin. Obviously the message was meant for her, but then again,
      Mhoram was curious of what could be of interest at this late hour. Mhoram
      untied the ribbon tying the parchment to the eagles foot and unfurled the
      message. It said...
      <P>
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"Drow attack on Cove! Arm thyself!"</FONT>
      <P>
      Mhoram wheeled about to Laurana and Rikku who were still in conversation.<BR>
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"Cove is under attack!"</FONT> He shouted,
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"To arms! we must help our allies!"</FONT>
      <P>
      Mhoram and Rikku snatched up their swords and donned their helms. Laurana
      tied her bandana and strung her bow. The three of them flung open the metal
      doors and raced through the forest toward Cove. Rikku and Mhoram crashed
      through the scrub, breaking twig underfoot and sending birds to flight. Laurana
      moved silently and almost unseen as she floated ghost-like between the trees.
      <P>
      Mhoram's stamina kept him ahead of the rest, and he shouted back to meet
      him at the gates of Cove. <BR>
      Before long, Mhoram had reached the gates of Cove. Dark figures could be
      seen through the gates......They certainly weren't Covians! Maybe in all
      his haste, he had arrived here first? One thing was for sure, there was one
      Covian he could make out, he was alone, and probably in trouble.
      <P>
      With not a moment to lose, Mhoram ran through the gate and into town.
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"What goes on here!?"</FONT> he demanded, hoping to
      stall some precious moments for the others to arrive. But no sooner had the
      words left his mouth when a loud shriek, accompanied by a blinding light
      seemed to rent the air before his eyes. A magical gate floated there, suspended
      in mid air...They were escaping!<BR>
      Mhoram ran forward toward the gate, one woman had still to pass through.
      Maybe he could catch her?<BR>
      As he approached she whirled round and snaked out her blade, straight towards
      his throat. Only his combat reactions saved him as he bought up his shield
      just in time to fling her arm backwards.<BR>
      Mhoram, enraged by the act, raised his sword aloft and bought it down in
      force. But the woman was more agile than expected and she darted back, however,
      she was indeed gashed by the sword on her left shoulder. She let no scream
      escape her lips though. Instead, she made a cruel smile and her blade snaked
      out again. This time, Mhorams shield was too far to block the blade.<BR>
      No matter though, as a streak of black darted through the air, straight through
      the Drow's arm, forcing her to drop her blade.<BR>
      Mhoram turned briefly to look over his shoulder. Laurana was stood by the
      gates, her ash bow leveled in their direction, hand still open where she
      had released the deadly shaft, her hair flying behind her like a banner in
      the stormy breeze that had blown up. An expression of grim determination
      was set upon her face. She smiled briefly, then turned to her left.<BR>
      Rikku had just arrived, weapon in hand, ready to face whatever threat came
      at the three of them. She clapped Laurana on the shoulder and stalked toward
      Mhoram.<BR>
      Mhoram turned back to the drow, who was crouched low, holding her arm. Her
      blade was nowhere to be seen though, and before he knew, her blade was coming
      at him again.<BR>
      Mhoram smashed it aside and dealt her a blow to her head with the flat of
      his blade, knocking the Drow out.<BR>
      <IMG src="http://home.graffiti.net/gregoreason/eason/drow-attack.jpg"><BR>
      <I>Skirmishing with Drow on the farms of Cove.</I>
      <P>
      Another shriek with a blinding light heralded the collapse of the gate.<BR>
      The pounding of booted feet heralded the arrival of the Covians. They arrived
      in a tight group, fanning out to a line to inspect the scene before them.
      <P>
      Mhoram turned and addressed the Covians. <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"Hail Commander.
      We received the message you sent and ran here as fast as we could. It seems
      we arrived just in time. Most of the attackers have left, but I managed to
      knock one down before she escaped."</FONT><BR>
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"Good"</FONT>, replied Commander Eason, "Thankyou for
      your quick action".<BR>
      He and his men approached the still form of the Drow. Before long, his men
      set to work reviving the Drow for questioning.<BR>
      Mhoram proceeded to explain the situation to the Commander.
      <P>
      The action was not over though. Guttural shouts of defiance erupted from
      the north side of Cove. The attackers were back, and they were setting upon
      the townspeople.<BR>
      A number of Covians sprang into action and charged through the town towards
      the invaders, swords and axes held high, screaming in rage at the drow
      invaders.<BR>
      Mhoram turned to the prisoner wanting some answers, judging the amount of
      Covians running at the attackers enough to repel them.<BR>
      But the drow was nowhere to be seen!<BR>
      Revived, and with some inhuman metabolism, she had escape during the confusion!
      Pounding his fist on his hip, Mhoram cursed aloud and turned back toward
      the Commander, only to find him gone too, with a handful of Covians left
      behind guarding the gate.
      <P>
      Concerned for the safety of the Commander, Mhoram ran through the town, searching
      for the covians and attackers.<BR>
      He didn't have to run for long.<BR>
      The Covians were tight in a block formation, surrounded by Drow.<BR>
      Commander Eason barked orders left and right of him. Taking control of his
      men.<BR>
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"Hold tight men! don't give an inch! we'll hold them
      here until they lay dead. Remember your training! Keep together!"</FONT>
      <BR>
      <IMG src="http://home.graffiti.net/gregoreason/eason/drow-form.jpg"><BR>
      <I>Squire Mhoram and the Hospitallers regroup with the Militia.</I>
      <P>
      Mhoram stared in appreciation of Eason's control and in disbelief of the
      attackers numbers. He hadn't thought there were this many before!<BR>
      He hadn't a moment to lose, he had to act. Mhoram turned on his heels and
      stormed back through the town. Thunder pealed overhead, and rain pounded
      the town.<BR>
      He reached the remaining Covians, Rikku and Laurana who were standing watch
      at the gates.<BR>
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"To me! To me!"</FONT> He shouted.
      <FONT COLOR="#dfdfdf">"The Drow are attacking the Commander!"</FONT>
      <P>
      Rikku and Laurana were first into action. Rikku's teeth gritted, her hair
      matted to her face by the rain. She looked a menacing foe as charged forth.<BR>
      Laurana hot on her heels, drawing an arrow from her quiver even as she ran.<BR>
      Covians close behind, and all of them ran through the town towards the enemy.
      <P>
      As they arrived, Commander Eason barked his orders to break into a skirmish,
      to hunt down the enemy and make them pay for their crimes.
      <P>
      The sounds of battle could be heard all over the town. It seemed the enemy
      specialised in hiding before striking and retreating to the shadows once
      more.<BR>
      The battle raged on, Victory for the alliance of Cove and Knights Hospitaller
      seeming sure every time, before yet another Drow appeared to strike from
      the darkness.
      <P>
      Finally, the last Drow was knocked down, with the rest of them either knocked
      down or fleeing in haste from Cove.<BR>
      Victory had been decisive, but not without its casualties, with injuries
      from both sides of the alliance.<BR>
      Laurana had been poisoned by one of the Drow as she had marked him and hunted
      him through the town. Fate had not been on her side, but her bravery and
      courage certainly had, enabling her to rain her tips of steel upon the enemy
      to throw them into confusion as they fought the Covians.<BR>
      Rikku, whilst fighting valiantly had also beaten down one of the Drow, and
      the menacing grin across her face did nothing to hide her satisfaction.<BR>
      The Covians had fought excellently, showing strength in numbers, iron discipline
      and were a sight to marvel in the heat of battle. <BR>
      <IMG src="http://home.graffiti.net/gregoreason/eason/drow-gather.jpg">
      <BR>
      <I>Upon defeat of the Drow, a final search of Cove is made.</I>
      <P>
      The day was won, the Covians patrolled the walls once again, and as Laurana,
      Rikku and Mhoram left through the gates of Cove, they couldn't help but feel
      proud...............a drink was most certainly in order!
