      <I>Written by Guardsman Recruit Ahmed Al Maktoum, 15th March 2005</I><BR>

      <B>Ahmed Al Maktoum= <SPAN style="color: Navy;">Navy</SPAN> <BR />
      Ryan Greystone = <SPAN style="color: red;">Red</SPAN></B><BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: navy;">Wha&#146; the&#133;*stares at the urn on the
      table*&#133;wha&#146; the&#133;*Peers inside the Urn* Oh my god !! Ack !!
      Wha&#146; the fark am I mean&#146;t to do? Carry this &#145;man&#146; around
      with me ?! Gah&#133;</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      I read over the note again, still wondering why he would ever come to the
      Militia for this quest, instead of some dumb ol&#146; mercenaries. Although
      it was given to me and I guess I have to do it. First point of call is to
      figure out where all the places are. <BR />
      <BR />

      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: Navy;"><I>The paladin library ey&#133;Oh I&#146;ve been
      there before, Ryan made me wear a dress to get some vital information last
      time *shakes fist*&#133;.even though it worked. Right so off to
      Trinsic.</I></SPAN><BR />
      <BR />
      And off to Trinsic indeed. I got there in no time, although this time I
      didn&#146;t have my dress with me. I asked how much to enter, and they wanted
      five-bloody-thousand crowns. I don&#146;t even get that in a whole years
      worth of working, only because I spend so much on ale *grins*. Those bloody
      paladin knocked me out for &#145;bad-mouthing&#146; them and in the name
      of Trinsic&#133;I can only say &#145;pfft&#146; to that. Nonetheless, I paid
      the fee and took the bloody urn to the place. That library had only one of
      my favorite books, and probably the favorite book for all men in the whole
      of Sosaria !! *Drools*<BR />
      <BR />

      <BR />
      But enough here, better move on. <BR />
      <BR />
      Right *picks up the urn and sighs*...off to Jhelom docks, Junior Ryan sir
      normally works on &#145;is boat there, maybe &#145;e&#146;ll be able to take
      us to &#145;Valor Island&#146;.<BR />
      <BR />
      I reached to the docks and only to see Ryan sir having an argument with the
      dock master there about repairs on his boat. But after he saw me, he immediately
      put me to work to fix his ship. As soon as I set my eyes on the so called
      &#145;ship&#146;, my first incentive was to&#133;point and laugh at the damn
      thing. Ryan gave me a swift smack across my head gave me a hammer and
      nails.<BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: Navy;">*Hammers away at the boat, grumbling* Bloody
      &#145;ell, this ship is better off as a plank of
      wood&#133;</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      I got the ship all fixed, but that wasn&#146;t enough for Ryan to take me
      over to Valor Island, he wanted a payment. I tried my luck with a magic saw
      and a flying carpet, but none of them suited him. But, he did like to see
      me dance *grins*. That was fine with me, as I knew the exact song to sing
      and dance to, to drive Ryan crazy !!<BR />
      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: Navy;"><I>*Starts doing a jig and sings
      terribly*</I></SPAN><BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img207.exs.cx/img207/4268/recruittrialdocks5rf.jpg" alt=""

      <BR />
      Well that plan worked, as usual. Off we set off to Valor Island, almost getting
      killed on a numerous number of times on the way. But nevertheless, we made
      it&#133;in a few more than one piece&#133;I think&#133;<BR />
      <BR />

      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: Navy;"><I>*Jumps off the boat and checks if all his limbs
      are still in place* Phew&#133;right, lets go then, this way *points and starts
      walking*</I></SPAN><BR />
      <BR />

      <BR />
      And it was an amazing scene, the shrine. With a massive symbol of valor and
      a singing sword imbedded in the center of it. I took out the Urn again and
      place it on the symbol. Five seconds later&#133;<BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: navy;">Roit lets go then&#133;</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: red;">Wha&#146; ?! I just took you over dangerous
      water for tha&#146; ?!</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: navy;">Umm, maybe&#133;</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: red;"><I>I&#146;m goin&#146; t&#146; kill you !! *Takes
      out his cutlass*</I></SPAN><BR />
      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: navy;"><I>Ahh fark *starts running and
      screaming*</I></SPAN><BR />
      <BR />
      Ryan was faster than me and he got to the ship first. I&#146;m an old man
      !!...and I have a bad back !! Anyway, he refused to let me on the boat till
      I actually gave him a real payment for his &#145;time lost&#146;...pfft !!
      I told him that I didn&#146;t have any crowns on me, and I&#146;d pay him
      on land.<BR />
      <BR />
      Once we got on land, I made a run for it. Ten seconds later, Ryan caught
      up with me and put a cutlass to my throat.<BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img239.imageshack.us/img239/4243/recruittrialtag2cp.jpg"

      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: red;">Where are my crowns !?</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: navy;">I don&#146;t have any !! I spend it all on
      ale !! *chokes* I can be your slave for a day !!!</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: red;">Really ?...hmm&#133;that&#146;ll do for now I guess
      *grins*[/i]</SPAN><BR />
      <BR />
      Ryan decided to tag along with me for the last part of my quest, the venture
      to the lost tomb, deep in the land of Ilshnear. It was getting dark so we
      jogged over there. And alas ! there was the cave as described in the note.
      I said my prayers and we entered the cave. It wasn&#146;t exactly what I
      pictured it as it would be, because it was full off spiders !! *shudders*
      <BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img236.exs.cx/img236/38/recruittrialspiders8gt.jpg" alt=""

      <BR />
      We basically ran in circles for ages until we found the exit. But there were
      more of them farkers !! We managed to hold them off, we Ryan was able to
      while I pointed and laughed *chuckles*. Finding the teleporter, we took it
      and arrived at the lost tomb. Inside were hundreds and hundreds of deadies
      !! I&#146;ve never seen so many in one place before !! We battled them out
      like we have for many years now and it seemed to get easier and easier every
      time *grins*.<BR />
      <BR />
      <IMG src="http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/2416/recruittrialtomb6rr.jpg"

      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: navy;">Look !! Over there, the deepest part of the
      tomb ! Run ye ejit !!</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <SPAN style="color: red;"><I>Shut up ye bald ejit !! Just run
      !!</I></SPAN><BR />
      <BR />
      I placed the urn on the chair that was there and gazed around for a bit.
      I said my goodbyes to the urn while Ryan held back the undead horde. <BR
	  />
      <BR />
      We got out of the cave in one piece, only to see the largest tree I&#146;ve
      ever seen, glowing bright orange. Ryan went up to it, only to be burned by
      a fireball it spat out !! <BR />
      <BR />

      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: red;">Aieee !! Kill the tree !!</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      <I><SPAN style="color: navy;">Kill&#133;the&#133;tree ?</SPAN></I><BR />
      <I><BR />
      <SPAN style="color: red;">Yes you bald ejit&#133;come on
      !!!</SPAN></I><BR />
      <BR />
      Bah, I&#146;ve never seen a tree like that in my entire life, and I&#146;m
      glad. <BR />

      <BR />
      The journey is over, off to back home to Cove. Ryan decided to visit the
      tavern for ale. I went back to the barracks for a good nights&#146; sleep.
